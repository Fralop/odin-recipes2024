    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This whiskey sour recipe has <strong>all the right proportions of bright, bracing lemon juice; warming, floral bourbon; and sweet simple syrup</strong> to deliver a refreshing cocktail that's neither too cloying nor too biting. Using freshly squeezed juice is <em>essentialâ€”the stuff that comes out of fruit-shaped squeeze bottles doesn't even compare.</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>bourbon</li>
      <li>fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>simple syrup</li>
      <li>orange wheel (for serving)</li>
      <li>Maraschino cherry (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine bourbon, lemon juice, and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker.</li>
        <li>Fill shaker with ice, cover, and shake vigorously until outside of shaker is very cold, about 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Strain cocktail through a Hawthorne strainer or a slotted spoon into an old-fashioned or rocks glass filled with ice. Garnish with orange wheel and cherry.</li>
    </ol>
